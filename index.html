        <h1>Exploring the Basics of Email Communication</h1>
        <h2>Email</h2>             
        <p>An email is a method of exchanging digital messages over the internet. It stands for "electronic mail." With email, individuals can send messages, files, or documents to others with an email address. Emails are typically composed using an email client or webmail service, and they can include text, attachments, and multimedia content. The communication is asynchronous, meaning the sender and recipient don't need to be online at the same time for the message to be delivered. Email is a widely used form of communication for both personal and professional purposes.</p>
